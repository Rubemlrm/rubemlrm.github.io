Hi there

Well looks that i have to write a little about me =)

Well I'm 26 years old , from a small town called SÃ£o Mamede that belongs to Leiria District . I've started my tech adventure in 2004 , taking a High School course relative to IT technician , during this course I've started gain a passion for the web development and system administration.

At this moment i have +5 year of experience related to web development using languages like php , html,css,js , in the recent months I've start working with coffeescript , sass and mongodb techs. Besides that on my SysAdmin experience i've worked with nginx/apache web servers , mysql and mongodb databases , docker/jails/vmware/vagrant for virtualization and containers services.

On my free time , i'm a volunteer firefigher on the firehouse of my town.

Any doubt or question , just ask =)
